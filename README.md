# How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?
#    Writing maintainable, readable, and adaptable code, better known as CRUD is a good way to catch or reduce errors, and maximize efficiency.  
#    Working this way will help you develop your skill and help you with good project management going forward
#    You can take the CRUD methodology that you learn, and apply it in order to help organizatins operate more efficiently, and provide better service to the company and customers as a whole.



# How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?  You approach it with an open mind, and apply your project management skills to deliver solutions.  My approach was a bit more calculated.  I want to approach this project wit a more porgram management methodolgy.  I will use CRUD methodolologies on all projects going forward.  You can't go wrong with this method.  




# What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?  Well, most importantly, a computer scientest will offer Grazioso data management, analysis, and most important security.  CS help customers to make better decisions for the future as far as data solutions.  This, intern generates growth and employment.
